# Intractive-Led-DIsplay
Intractive Led Display is a display where each pixel is an interactive element. LED displays are capable of providing general illumination in addition to visual display, as when used for stage lighting or other decorative (as opposed to informational) purposes.
In this code we've built a T-rex game using Arduino plateform just as beginning.
