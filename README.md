# Intractive-Led-DIsplay
Intractive Led Display capable of displaying anything. The pixel used in this display are Leds.
An LED display is a flat panel display, which uses an array of light-emitting diodes as pixels for a video display. Their brightness allows them to be used outdoors in store signs and billboards, and in recent years they have also become commonly used in destination signs on public transport vehicles. LED displays are capable of providing general illumination in addition to visual display, as when used for stage lighting or other decorative (as opposed to informational) purposes.
In this code we've built a T-rex game using Arduino plateform.
